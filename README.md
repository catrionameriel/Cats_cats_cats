# Brief

Use the provided start_point and complete the following tasks:

1. Add JS code to allow a new cat to be added programmatically. Do it rough and ready at first!
2. Refactor the code to make it easy to add a new cat, just like we did with the quotes.
3. EXTENSION: Remove the cat data in the HTML and add them via your javascript. If you want to be fancy, put the cat data into an array.
4. EXTENSION: Style the site!
